    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. It's a hearty meal that's perfect for feeding a crowd or for making ahead and freezing for later. Here's how to make it:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
      <li>800g can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>white sauce (find a recipe in the method, or use shop-bought)</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>100g mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>100g rated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>12 lasagna sheets</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 190Â°C. In a large frying pan, cook the mince over medium heat until brown. Add the onion and garlic and cook until onion is tender. Drain the fat. Stir in tomato sauce, salt, oregano, and water. Simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 33x23cm baking dish. Layer with uncooked lasagna noodles, white sauce, mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Add a 1/2 cup of water around the edge of the pan. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
